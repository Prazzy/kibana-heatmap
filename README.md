# Kibana Heatmap

**Disclaimer: This is a students project of the PPI AG and does not represent overall code quality at PPI AG.**

Instead of displaying all Log-Events in a continuous timeline the heatmap panel displays all events in one-hour time slices. 
So you can easly analyse the activity over time in your system.

In the current version the heatmap supports three diffrent colorings:

### Features in current version:
 - legend & tooltips in 2D view
 - panable and zoomable 3D View     
 - three diffrent color schemas 

### TODOs 
- support of aggregate functions like (min, max, mean etc. ) 
- improve 3D view (tooltips, legend, etc.)
- support for the different Kibana themes
- adjustable time-slicing


### Installation 

To install the heatmap you just need to put the heatmap folder in the ```app/panels/``` direcotry of your Kibana installation.
After that you just need to add ```heatmap``` to the panel_names list in your kibana ```config.js```.

```js

/* [...] */

    panel_names: [
      
      'heatmap', /* diesen Eintrag hinzuf√ºgen */
      
      'histogram',
      'map',
      'goal',
      
      /* [...] */
    ]

/* [...] */

```


## Requirements

The heatmap panel expects that your documents have a attribut which identifies in which time-slice the document belongs.
This time-slice attribut should like this:

1-Mo:23-24 

So the geberal format is: [weekdayAsNumber]-[weekdayAsString]:[hourstart]-[hourend]


## Development

Kibana uses jQuery flot for the plotting of the diagramms. So we implemented at first a flot heatmap plugin which is used to render the 2D view of the heatmap. 
At moment our heatmap flot plugin renders the legend in the canvas itself and not as html as the other flot plugins. 
Because of this we currently do not support Kibana themes swichtes. The color of the legend texts are defined in ```options.series.heatmap.fontColor``` in the ```jquery.flot.heatmap.js```

For the rendering of the 3D view we use [THREE.js](http://threejs.org/).

We are looking forward to further develop the panel and to improve the code quality. The current version is very rudimentary. 

Your help is very appreciated!
